- When link error comes: `collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status`
  - run compile with verbose such as `make VERBOSE=1`
  - Find the compiling command actually done
  - Go to the folder where the compile crashed
  - Try the same command from CLI
  - When the same error messsage is found, begin trouble-shooting
  - Mostly adding necessary libraries in the compiling command will solve the issue
  - Or update LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- When  `error: invalid new-expression of abstract class type 'XX'`
  - Ref: https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/1004768/Invalid-new-expression-of-abstract-class-type
  - If a class inherits from a parent class, some of virtual functions are not explicitly defined in the new class
