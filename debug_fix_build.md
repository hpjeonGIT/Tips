- When link error comes: `collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status`
  - run compile with verbose such as `make VERBOSE=1`
  - Find the compiling command actually done
  - Go to the folder where the compile crashed
  - Try the same command from CLI
  - When the same error messsage is found, begin trouble-shooting
  - Mostly adding necessary libraries in the compiling command will solve the issue
  - Or update LD_LIBRARY_PATH
